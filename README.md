The field of Natural Computing concerns the development of algorithms inspired by Nature, including Biological, Social and Physical systems. These algorithms draw metaphorical inspiration from diverse aspects of nature, including the operation of biological neurons, processes of evolution, and models of social interaction amongst organisms. They are used to tackle complex real-world problems. This course provides an introduction to Natural Computing algorithms and illustrates how they can be applied to real-world problems using case studies.

The course covers the following topics:

* Evolutionary Computation
* Immunocomputing
* Swarm Intelligence
* Evolutionary Game Theory, Cellular Automata
* Deep Neural Networks
